# Introduction
This is a project that was spawned from the "HoloRewind 2020" collaboration project between Hololive Resistance and A≈çnahara Translations. I volunteered to help download clips for the project, and quickly found myself in need of a tool that could download a portion of not only YouTube videos, but also videos from sites like BiliBili and archives like v.ikx. On top of that, HoloRewind had its own unique standards for downloading clips that other clipping utilities did not have. Thus, I spent a grand total of 5 days both teaching myself PowerShell scripting and creating the very first version of what is now this project.
# Requirements
Standalone PowerShell Script:
1) ffmpeg - Version 4.3.1 or Newer
2) youtube-dl - Version 2020.11.01.1 or Newer
3) ffmpeg + youtube-dl added to PATH

Release Binaries:
1) None

NOTE: In a future version of the tool, I will be adding support for CUDA. Once this is implemented, you will need to have the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit installed.
