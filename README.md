So, apparently windows recognizes clipper.exe as a harmful program. Believe me, it's not. You can check the source code right here on this repo. All it is is clippser.ps1 compiled into a windows executable by PS2EXE. If you don't believe me, feel free to compile clipper.ps1 yourself and replace clipper.exe in the release folder. Bottom line is, even if windows gives you a warning, the program's fine.

I plan to recreate HoloClipper from the ground up, this time using C++ to both run the GUI and handle the automation of ffmpeg and ytdl. Of course, I'm still a beginner when it comes to C++. But I've never let that stop me before. Here's to a brighter future, and a better HoloClipper.
